# Hotseat_Network
This project consists of a network of square simple sitting pads that count every time anyone sits on them and illuminate a color based on their relative usage in the network. The colour of the illuminated seats range from blue, meaning the least used seat, to red, indicating the highest and hottest seat usage among a series of seats.
