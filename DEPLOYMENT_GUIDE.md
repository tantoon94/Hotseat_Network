# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide - Fixed Issues

## 🚨 Issues That Were Causing Deployment Failures

### 1. **File Name Case Sensitivity** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: `index.HTML` (uppercase) instead of `index.html` (lowercase)
- **Fix**: Renamed file to `index.html`
- **Why**: GitHub Pages is case-sensitive and expects lowercase filenames

### 2. **Missing Configuration Files** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: `mqtt-config.json` and `qr_codes/` were excluded by `.gitignore`
- **Fix**: Updated `.gitignore` to include these files for deployment
- **Why**: GitHub Pages needs these files to function properly

### 3. **GitHub Actions Workflow Issues** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Workflow was trying to deploy to `gh-pages` branch instead of `main`
- **Fix**: Updated workflow to deploy to `main` branch
- **Why**: Your repository uses `main` branch for GitHub Pages

## 🚀 How to Deploy Successfully

### Step 1: Commit All Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment issues"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages (if not already done)
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Choose **main** branch
6. Select **/ (root)** folder
7. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub Pages will automatically deploy your site
- Check the **Actions** tab to see deployment progress
- Your site will be available at: `https://tantoon94.github.io/Hotseat_Network/`

## 📁 Required Files for Deployment

The following files are now included and required:

```
✅ index.html              # Main dashboard (renamed from index.HTML)
✅ mqtt-config.json        # MQTT configuration (now included)
✅ firebase-config.js      # Firebase configuration
✅ qr_codes/               # Generated QR codes (now included)
✅ seat1.html - seat5.html # Individual seat pages
✅ analytics.html          # Analytics dashboard
✅ All other HTML files
```

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **File Structure**
- Renamed `index.HTML` → `index.html`
- Ensured all required files are committed

### 2. **GitHub Actions**
- Updated workflow to deploy to `main` branch
- Added file verification steps
- Created backup workflow for preparation

### 3. **Configuration**
- Updated `.gitignore` to include deployment files
- Generated QR codes for production URLs
- Ensured MQTT config is available

## 🌐 Live URLs After Deployment

Once deployed successfully, your site will be available at:

- **Main Dashboard**: `https://tantoon94.github.io/Hotseat_Network/`
- **Seat 1**: `https://tantoon94.github.io/Hotseat_Network/seat1.html`
- **Seat 2**: `https://tantoon94.github.io/Hotseat_Network/seat2.html`
- **Seat 3**: `https://tantoon94.github.io/Hotseat_Network/seat3.html`
- **Seat 4**: `https://tantoon94.github.io/Hotseat_Network/seat4.html`
- **Seat 5**: `https://tantoon94.github.io/Hotseat_Network/seat5.html`
- **Analytics**: `https://tantoon94.github.io/Hotseat_Network/analytics.html`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Still Fails:

1. **Check GitHub Actions**
   - Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
   - Look for any error messages
   - Ensure the workflow completes successfully

2. **Verify File Names**
   - All HTML files should be lowercase
   - Check that `index.html` exists in root directory

3. **Check GitHub Pages Settings**
   - Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for `main` branch
   - Verify the source is set to root directory

4. **Test Locally First**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

## 🔒 Security Note

The `mqtt-config.json` file now contains credentials that are visible in the repository. For production use, consider:

1. Using environment variables
2. Setting up a backend service
3. Using Firebase Functions for secure credential management

## ✅ Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:

1. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow completes without errors
2. ✅ GitHub Pages shows "Your site is live at..."
3. ✅ You can access `https://tantoon94.github.io/Hotseat_Network/`
4. ✅ All pages load without 404 errors
5. ✅ MQTT connection works (or falls back to demo mode)
6. ✅ Firebase integration works

## 📞 Need Help?

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all files are committed to the repository
3. Ensure GitHub Pages is properly configured
4. Test the site locally before deploying
